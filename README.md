# Customer-Churn-Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer data and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of customer churn. The analysis is conducted through a Jupyter Notebook (`CustomerChurn.ipynb`) that walks through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

## Features
The project leverages machine learning algorithms to classify whether a customer is likely to churn. Key steps include:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training and Testing
- Performance Evaluation

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (install using the command below):

  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```
  
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Vaibhavv1703/Customer-Churn-Analysis.git
      cd Customer-Churn-Analysis
      ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook CustomerChurn.ipynb
      ```
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to explore the customer data.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for analysis is assumed to be available in the notebook or needs to be provided separately.
- Ensure the dataset is in the correct format before running the notebook.
